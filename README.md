# Databricks

This implementation provides a Databricks solution with:

- **Incremental processing** using Auto Loader and Delta Lake streaming
- **Medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- **Cost optimization** through job clusters and autoscaling
- **ML integration** with MLflow tracking and model registry
- **Data consistency** using Delta Lake time travel
- **Performance optimization** with Photon engine and caching

The code is modular and can be deployed as separate notebooks or 
jobs in your Databricks workspace.
